# Computer Vison Project 2019

__Self-Driving Car Exploiting Supervised Learning via a CNN__

This project was presented on the 11th of January 2019 in the Department of Computer Science of La Sapienza University in Rome, Italy. It is a Self-Driving Car 3D model built in Unity, with the task of line following. The model takes directions on how to steer the car properly from a Convolutional Neural Network predicting the right steering angle, with a supervised learning approach. For any information about the system, look at the slides in the directory [CV-pres.pdf](https://github.com/matteoprata/self-driving-car-cnn/blob/master/CV-pres.pdf), feel free to contact us for any additional detail.

In order to try out our CNN model, please download our 3D Unity worlds and neural model at [this page](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IYWDhFTBd9vCNAf542-1642-hCGFpt-Y?usp=sharing). Locate either the model or the worlds in the same directory as the Main.py file. Run Main.py file and start the game application (choose ScreenCapture mode). Be sure to have imported all the dependencies required by the project (OpenCv, Keras...).
